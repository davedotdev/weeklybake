__Important Notes__

<b id="f0">[0]</b> Caffeine or a substitutable stimulus is the only important ingredient. Harder substances may be used, but for legal reasons, they cannot be listed or mentioned here.[↩](#a0)

<b id="f1">[1]</b> It might appear like there's two weeks worth of ingredients. Do not worry. This will reduce during the baking process. [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">[2]</b> You may want to keep the details vague. A surprise assassination might be an unwelcome one. [↩](#a2)

<b id="f3">[3]</b> Some recipe designers are experimenting with four days. They are not yet widely applicable. If you are unable to fulful five days of baking, do not be alarmed, the ingredients will keep well beyond their shelf life and best before dates. In addition, if a near term catastrophic fate awaits you, rest in peace knowing that an average chef can pick it up without much fuss.[↩](#a3)

<b id="f4">[4]</b> You may find ingredients from the previous week in your bake. Do not be alarmed. Despite trashing the remaining bake, ingredients are stubborn, reufse almost any removal attempt and insist on being baked multiple times. [↩](#a4)

<b id="f5">[5]</b> This recipe is applicable to side projects. Reduce the ingredients to the time period required and bake accordingly. Results are predictable through scale reduction. [↩](#a5)
